Vim Mono E Ink Color Scheme
===========================

This color scheme was developed for use with an Onyx Mira Boox screen.

Normally text is black on a white background.

Many highlight groups are not colored especially. Numbers, preprocessor directives, etc. can immediately be identified anyway without being colored especially. In any case when using a monochrome display there are limited options to uniquely "color" text.

Diffs are handled well by this color scheme.

Some might enjoy using this color scheme on a color display. There is sparing use of color.
